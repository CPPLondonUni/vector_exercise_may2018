# C++ London Uni Vector Exercise #

This is a short exercise to get you familiar with using `std::vector`.

The file `main.cpp` contains a list of instructions for you to follow.
Make sure that you understand what each `vector` member function is doing.

If you need help, you can find reference documentation for `vector`
[on cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector),
or lots more material in chapter 18 of the textbook.
