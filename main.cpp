    // 1. Create a vector of ints containing elements 1, 2, 3

    // 2. Use assert() to check that the vector contains three elements

    // 3. Add two more elements to the back of the array
    //    What is its new capacity?

    // 4. Remove the last element from the array
    //    What is its size?
    //    What is its capacity?

    // 5. Use a range-for loop to set every element of the vector to 42

    // 6. Set the second element of the vector to 99
    //    Hint: remember C++ indexes arrays from zero!

    // 7. Use a range-for loop to print every element of the function
    //    For bonus points: make this a separate function called print_vec()

    // 8. Use a single member function to remove all elements from the vector
    //    Use assert() to check that this has worked correctly

    // 9. What is the capacity of your vector now?
    //    Use a member function to reset the capacity to zero

    // 10. Try reading the 99th element of the vector. What happens?
    //     Now, try using the at(idx) member function to read the 99th element.
    //     What happens this time?
